SvelteKit RAG Chat Application

This is a test document for the RAG-powered chat application. The application features:

1. Document Upload: Users can upload text documents (.txt files) directly from the chat interface.

2. RAG Pipeline: Uploaded documents are automatically processed into the RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipeline.

3. Intelligent Chunking: Documents are split into intelligent chunks of approximately 500 tokens each for optimal processing.

4. Vector Embeddings: Each chunk is converted to vector embeddings using Google Gemini's embedding model.

5. Context-Aware Responses: The AI uses relevant document context when answering questions.

6. Fallback System: If no relevant context is found, the system falls back to regular chat responses.

7. User Control: Users can say "answer me out of that context" to skip document context.

8. Citation Tracking: The AI cites which documents were used for context.

Technical Features:
- Built with SvelteKit
- PostgreSQL database with pgvector extension
- Google Gemini for embeddings
- OpenAI for text generation
- Real-time streaming responses
- Git-like branching system for conversations
- Search functionality across chats and messages

The application provides a seamless experience for users to upload documents and have intelligent conversations with context-aware AI responses.
